# Improvement Suggestions For The Hennge UI

### Paginate The Mail List

The UI can be paginated. Pagination is a very cruial feature in a mail app like this. It has tremendous advantage both on the client side to improve the user experience when searching for a mail and as well as on the server side to efficiently query the database in the most optimal way.

### Mails Should Include Severity Level of The Issue

The auditing team should be able to view and sort mails based on severity and have a detailed count of the different severity levels in the app. This can provide quick visibility to the issue and help the audit team prioritize resolution based severity level.

### Improve Result Count Text

The result count text (mail(s)) isn't dynamic enough to adjust to the length of the list. I solved this problem in my submission.

### Implement Multiple Filter Parameters

The search/filter bar shoul be able to search by other mail parameters such as subject or sender email address. This can be mplemented by designing a filter panel at the top with filter options such as a text input and date/time search.
