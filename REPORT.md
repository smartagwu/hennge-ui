# How I Completed The Missions

I chose the React.js JavaScript framework because of it's efficiency, scalability, syntactical and design pattern. The app is also properly typed with the use of Typescript to avoid runtime errors and bugs arising in the code on a test or production environment.

For optimization and light weight, Implemented the design using function-based components rather than class-based component to keep the size small and efficient.

The project is structured based on the features and modules of the UI for easier understanding of the data flow and how components communicate together.

At mission 2, I designed a right pane that created multiple mail body to inspect without losing visibility of the mail list. This allows the app to be very flexible and makes data easily accessible to the user.

The app is also designed using CSS and very responsive for desktop and mobile size screens and devices. Each component has a seperate CSS file in order to seperate design concerns across the app and keep components and their data private and isolated from each other.
